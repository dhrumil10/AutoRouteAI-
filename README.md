> A Tesla-inspired project using multi-agent orchestration and OpenAI-powered reasoning to dynamically manage real-time traffic, optimize routes, and simulate autonomous decision-making.

---

## 🔍 Project Summary

**AutoRoute AI** is a smart traffic optimization system that simulates how Tesla vehicles (or cities) could handle real-time rerouting using **LLM-powered agents**. It leverages FastAPI, CrewAI (or LangGraph), OpenAI GPT, and real-time traffic feeds to minimize congestion, assist emergency vehicles, and explain routing decisions in natural language.

This project demonstrates the future of **AI-powered transport**, combining multi-agent intelligence with ethical, real-time traffic handling — fully aligned with Tesla’s mission to accelerate sustainable and intelligent transport.
